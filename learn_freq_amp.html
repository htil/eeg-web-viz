    <h1>What Do We Mean When We Say Frequency and Amplitude?</h1>
    <h2>Frequency</h2>
    <p>
      The rate at which a vibration occurs that constitutes a wave. It can be
      measured as the <b>wavelength</b> or the distance between each peak in the
      signal. Usually measured per second in Hertz(HZ). Frequency is also used
      to discover the pitch of a sound. A low pitch corresponds to a low
      frequency wave and a high frequency wave to a high pitch.
    </p>
    <a href="images/IMG_2766.jpeg">
      <img src="images/IMG_2766.jpeg" alt="Low Frequency Wave" />
    </a>
    <h2>What is the Difference Between High and Low Frequency</h2>
    <p>
      The measurement of frequency is in Hz. The higher the Hz the higher the
      frequency. For example, a sound that produces a wave of 500Hz has a lower
      frequency than a wave produced with 2000Hz. We show the difference in
      frequency on the graph with the distance between each peak or a term
      called bandwidth.
    </p>

      <img
        src="images/IMG_2765.jpeg"
        alt="Low, Medium, and High Frequency Wave."
      />
    </a>
    <h2>Wavelength</h2>
    <a href="images/IMG_2775.jpeg">
      <img
        src="images/IMG_2775.jpeg"
        alt="Low and High Frequency Wave with Wavelength."
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      A low frequency wave will also have a shorter wavelength than a high
      frequency wave. In the first image you can see that with higher frequency
      the amount of peaks increases shortening the wavelength in between each
      peak. So a higher frequency signal will naturally have a short wavelength
      and a low frequency signal will have a long wavelength.
    </p>

    <h2>Amplitude</h2>
    <p>
      Usually measured in meters, amplitude is used in physics to describe the
      maximum or minimum displacement of a moved point from its resting position
      on the line. When waves are generated by signal, the amplitude will be
      directly proportional to its source.
      <b>Think of the height of a Mountain.</b>
      When measuring a mountain's height, you have to start from the center and
      measure a straight verticle line up and down.
      <b>As shown in the figure below.</b>
    </p>
    <a href="images/IMG_2780.jpeg">
      <img
        src="images/IMG_2780.jpeg"
        style="width: 500px"
        alt="Picture of Mountain"
      />
    </a>
    <a href="images/IMG_2768.jpeg">
      <img
        src="images/IMG_2768.jpeg"
        style="width: 500px"
        alt="Picture of Amplitude"
      />
    </a>
    <p>
      Here you can see the arrow shows the vertical displacement of the peak
      from its origin in this wave. The same way you would measure a mountain.
      <b>That is Amplitude!</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Varying Amplitudes</h2>
    <a href="images/IMG_2777.jpeg">
      <img src="images/IMG_2777.jpeg" alt="Picture of Varying Amplitude" />
    </a>
    <p>
      Because the amplitude of a wave is the amount of energy it caries, it is
      directly related to the intensity of the sound. The more intense the sound
      is the louder it is percieved. A singal produced by a louder sound will
      have a higher amplitude than that of a softer sound.
    </p>
    <h2>Super Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      This occurs when there are mulitple waves that make up one signal. It can
      cause the amplitude to increase or decrease by however much the other
      signals amplitude was that is combined with said signal.
      <b>Superpositioning</b> is used in <b>FFT's</b> because reverting to the
      <b>time domain</b> from the <b>frequency domain</b> requires the multiple
      waves in a signal to combine back into one so that it can fit into the
      time domain with one wave.
    </p>
    <h4>Increasing</h4>
    <a href="images/IMG_2782.jpeg">
      <img src="images/IMG_2782.jpeg" alt="Picture of adding Amplitude" />
    </a>
    <p>
      In this example, you can see that Wave 1 and Wave 2 amplitudes are equal
      to 1x. They also have the same <b>frequency</b> and <b>wavelength</b>. So
      when they are combined, the new waves amplitude is equal to 2x
    </p>
    <h4>Decreasing</h4>
    <a href="images/IMG_2783.jpeg">
      <img src="images/IMG_2783.jpeg" alt="Picture of adding Amplitude" />
    </a>
    <p>
      In the decreasing figure, we see that Wave 1 starts off with a positive
      amplitude. But in Wave 2 the amplitude starts out negative. Because the
      amplitude of Wave 1 is positive where the amplitude of Wave 2 is negative
      they cancel each other out. This forms the straight line that you see in
      the resultant that has no amplitude or an amplitdue equal to 0
